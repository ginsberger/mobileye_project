Detecting traffic lights and the distance to them on runtime within given video.                          
using image processing and machine learning, Python.

                                                                                                               
a long project separated into 4 part.
### Part 1: Traffic Lights Attention
Detection of source lights in an image using convolution with customized high- and low-pass filters.
### Part 2: Traffic Light Detection and Prepare a dataset
creating data for the tarining using the products of the previous stage as input.                                                              
Generating and training CNN to conclude all the traffic lights in the image (using tensorflow). 
### Part 3:  Estimating the distance
Estimating the distance to each detected traffic light from the camera picturing the images of interest,                                             
involving geometric and linear algebra calculations.
### Part 4: Integration
Integrating all previous parts into a functional and intuitive SW product.
